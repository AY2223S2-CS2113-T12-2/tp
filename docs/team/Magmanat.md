## Overview
Hello, I'm Prince Pereira, an aspiring Computer Engineer studying at the National University of Singapore. Currently, I'm enrolled in CS2113, where I'm gaining valuable knowledge in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java.

Together with my team members, we have created a product known as Big PC Partpicker (BigPP). The following is a summary of my contributions to the team project Big PC Partpicker.
